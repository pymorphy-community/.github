# Pymorphy Community Organization

We are trying to revive and continue development of [Pymorphy2](https://github.com/pymorphy2/pymorphy2) project. See related issue: https://github.com/pymorphy2/pymorphy2/issues/160.

**Pymorphy2** is a morphological analyzer / inflection engine for Russian, Ukrainian, Belarusian and potentially for other slavic languages. This organization hosts forks of pymorphy2 repository itself, its direct dependencies (DAWG, DAWG-Python), dictionary building scripts and other tools.
